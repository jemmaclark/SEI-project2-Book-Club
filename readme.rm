# SEI Project 2 - Book Club app

## About
The Book Club App is a full-stack web application that allows users to discover, share and manage their favourite books. Users can create an account, add books to their library and in the future, connect with other book enthusiasts.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- EJS
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- Sessions for user authentication

## Planning and Problem Solving
### Planning
- The project was planned using a Trello board to manage tasks and track progress.
- User stories and wireframes were created to define the apps functionality from a users perspective. Wireframes were designed to visualise the apps layout and user interface.

### Problem Solving
During the development of the app, several challenges were encoutered and resolved through collaborative problem solving.
- Connecting the routes seemed to be the biggest issue i faced. The route for the delete button and edit button was affected when i added the "want_to_read" database. Debugging and troubleshooting were necesarry to ensure that the route and database queries functioned correctly.
- Ensuring secure user authentication and authorization required careful handling of user data and password hashing using bcrypt.

## Cool Things
One of my favourite feautres of the Book Club App is the ability to add books to your personal library for future reading.

## Lessons Learnt
Throughout the development of this project, several important lessons were learned:
- The project improved my understanding of full stack web development, invluding front end and back end intergration.
- Database management and learning how to correctly store data in different Databases.
- Extensive debugging and troubleshooting throughout the project improved my ability to address route and database issues.

## Current feautures
- User authentication and authorization.
- Adding books to a personal library.
- Viewing book details

## Future feautres
The Book Club App has great potential for future enhancements. Some planned future features include:
- User ratings and reviews for books.
- User comments and discussions.
- Social features for connecting with other users based on shared books.
- Book club groups. Users will have the ability to create and join book clubs or reading groups. Each group will have its own page where members can connect, share the books they plan to read, and engage in discussions.
